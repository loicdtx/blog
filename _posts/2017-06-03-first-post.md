This is the first post of my new blog (created today, the 3rd of June 2017). I'm a scientist, programmer and traveller and I plan to write here about some of the research I am doing, open source projects I like or contributed to, and why not a bit about places I visit.

Don't hesistate to leave a comment, even if useless, so that I can test the comment engine.
