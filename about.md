I'm Lo√Øc, I'm a french scientist with a PhD in satellite remote sensing. I do research about ecology, forest dynamics and ocean processes; I write open source software to work satellite images; and I cycle, run, climb and listen to a lot of music. I currently work at the National Comission for Biodiversity Knowledge ([CONABIO](https://www.gob.mx/conabio)) in Mexico City. Check my [webpage](http://www.loicdutrieux.net) if you want to know more.
